## Creating your circuit
First of all, it looks overwhelming isn't it? Have a look at your new space. You can see that on the right, you would be able to see all the basic components.<br>

With that, simply just click and drag the components that you need. We have shown you an example circuit on the slides and worksheet that you can refer to for your creation. Happy creating!
## Simulating your circuit
Now look to your top right. You can see this toolbar over here.
