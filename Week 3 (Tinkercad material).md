# TINKERCAD

Tinkercad is a free-of-charge, online 3D modeling program that runs in a web browser. Since it became available in 2011 it has become a popular platform for creating models for 3D printing as well as an entry-level introduction to constructive solid geometry in schools.

If you have been wanting to design your own 3D printed object, Tinkercad is a great starting point. Advanced modelers may prefer programs like Fusion 360, SolidWorks, and Blender, but these can have a steep learning curve. If you are looking to design your own 3D printed object in a modeling software, Tinkercad can get you there in no time.
The basics of Tinkercad are simple: you drag a shape onto the workplane, modify it, and combine it with other shapes.

## Tutorial 1
Once you've logged in, make sure 3D Designs is selected on the left and click Create new design.

Once you open a workspace, right-click and drag on the workplane, it will rotate. If you middle-click and drag on the workplane, it will pan. Try playing around with rotating and panning your workplane to get a feel for how it works.

You can also change the type of cube to be a hole instead of a solid like shown in the image below.

Change the angle to 45 degrees. You can change the angle of the body in any direction.

## Tutorial 2

Add a cube and change the dimensions as seen below

Place the text on the workspace and change the text to any word
![](images/TinkerSS/19.PNG)

Change the dimensions as shown below.

Change the text to hole and align both shapes as shown below
![](images/TinkerSS/23.PNG)

## Tutorial 3

Now let's make a part for the project
Make a workspace and edit the workplane
![](images/TinkerSS/28.PNG)
![](images/TinkerSS/29.PNG)

Add 2 boxes and change the dimensions to 
Box 1 (Solid): 200 X 150 X 60
Box 2 (Hole): 180 X 150 X 50
![](images/TinkerSS/34.PNG)

Align and group both boxes as shown below
![](images/TinkerSS/35.PNG)

It should look like this
![](images/TinkerSS/36.PNG)

Add another 2 boxes 
Box 1 (Solid): 10 X 10 X 50
Box 2 (Hole): 6 X 6 X 50
![](images/TinkerSS/38.PNG)

Align and group both boxes as shown
![](images/TinkerSS/39.PNG)

Copy and paste (ctrl + C, ctrl + V) the small figure 4 times
![](images/TinkerSS/42.PNG)

Change the 4 figures into holes
![](images/TinkerSS/43.PNG)

Align and group one of the small figures with the big figure as shown. Do the same for the other side.
![](images/TinkerSS/44.PNG)

Rotate 2 of the small figures 180 degrees.
![](images/TinkerSS/46.PNG)

Align and group the opposite figures to the opposite side of the big figure.
![](images/TinkerSS/47.PNG)

Rotate the new figure as shown.

![](images/TinkerSS/49.PNG)

Add a text (Hole) with the your Team's name
![](images/TinkerSS/50.PNG)

Align and group the text with the figure and Voil√† you got your car cover!!!
